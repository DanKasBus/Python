# Python projects

Hey!

Everything in this will be my learning of Python and just projects I decide to do with it!
Started learning 11/13/2023

Here's my current projects

1. Login Authentication

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/DanKasBus/Python.git`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`

## Login Authentication

A small script that handles login with a backoff timer

* [login.py](login_authentication/login.py)
